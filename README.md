# Virtual_Assistant_SE
It is speech recognition based and takes in speech as an input using the inbuilt SpeechRecognition module. The key features of this Virtual Assistant is that it can act  like a chat box that is you can converse with it, ask about the weather or the latest news or a joke using different web APIâ€™s. Using SpeechRecognition it recognizes the sentence and then converts it into String text. I then took key words from that string such as what, about, you, play, song, information, joke etc and based on them ran the most suited function under different functions. i was also able to communicate in Hindi as it picks out the key words. I have used the chrome web driver which enables to search on wikipedia or play song on youtube. It can open websites on youtube as per our command using the webbrowser package. I used the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech. The rate and voice can be adjusted as per our requirements.
